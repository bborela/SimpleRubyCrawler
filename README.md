=================

Paula's Choice is an authoritative online resource for skin products and (some might say conveniently) an online cosmetic retailer. They also have on their website a good cosmetic ingredient dictionary (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary) that rates the quality of ingredients you find in virtually every cosmetic. I however find its format somewhat cumbersome and decided to write a simple Ruby web crawler to gather this information into a simple CSV file using the Nokogiri library. This is my first Ruby script and my grasp of the language and its potential is mediocre at best, so I'm sure there are better ways to accomplish what I've done here.

You can find both the script and the CSV file in this repository.

(This is merely for educational purposes, so let's hope I'm not infringing any copyright issues with this simple exercise.)
